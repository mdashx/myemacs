## TODO:

* Try to figure out what I've added and removed from .emacs that I don't want to miss
* Automate package installation

Should all hooks go on in one place, and then their specific actions in a different file? Then it'd be easy to see all of the hooks and keybindings I've defined, but I can define the function they call somewhere else.

* How do other Emacs setups handling the load path?
* Replace Ido with Helm
* Add better mode line
* Get mode line glyphs in terminal?
