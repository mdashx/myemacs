## TODO:

* Try to figure out what I've added and removed from .emacs that I don't want to miss
* Automate package installation

Should all hooks go on in one place, and then their specific actions in a different file? Then it'd be easy to see all of the hooks and keybindings I've defined, but I can define the function they call somewhere else.

* ~~How do other Emacs setups handling the load path?~~
* ~~Replace Ido with Helm~~
* ~~Get powerline glyphs in terminal?~~
* Do a better job of setting up autocompletion
* ~~Why does my Ctrl-C 0 shortcut to toggle linewrap sometimes crash Emacs in the terminal?~~
* Define header templates for different types of source code files - use git config vars?
* Check environment vars to see if in terminal or in OSX
* Setup different Python modes based on env
* Setup GUI stuff based on env?
* Add keybinding for org-store-link
* Setup bookmarks file to open on start
* ~~Split window on start so visual-fill-column doesn't crash: https://github.com/joostkremers/visual-fill-column/issues/1#issuecomment-198032933~~
* ~~Global highlight line mode~~
